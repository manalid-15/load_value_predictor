This is a project on load value predictors. 
We have implemented 5 types of predictors using Intel Pin tool.
	1. Last-value predictor
	2. Stride predictor 
	3. Context predictor 
	4. Store-to-load predictor 
	5. Hybrid predictor (consists of stride predictor, context predictor, and store-to-load predictor)

The goal of this project is to observe the accuracy of these predictors with different table size, penalty and, confidence threshold.
